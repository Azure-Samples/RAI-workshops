    "# Generate Synthetic Data with Conversation Starters\n",
    "\n",
    "Contoso Zoo is developing an AI-powered smart guide app to enhance visitors' experiences. The app aims to answer questions about wildlife. To evaluate the responses from the app, we need to create a comprehensive synthetic question-answer dataset that covers various aspects of wildlife, including animal behavior, habitat preferences, and dietary needs. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will generate a synthetic question-answer dataset for the Contoso Zoo app. This dataset will not only include standard question-answer pairs but also incorporate conversation starters to simulate contextually relevant interactions. These conversation starters will allow for pre-specified, repeatable user turns in a conversation, which is crucial for evaluating the AI's performance across different scenarios.\n"
