# Train the Trainer Resources
Responsible AI workshops are available on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/training) as training modules. Learners will earn a badge upon completion of the module and can save their earned badges by creating a profile. If you're facilitating a workshop which leverages our Microsoft Learn training modules, we encourage you to also leverage the accompanying slide deck provided in this repository.

## Access to Azure OpenAI
Our workshops require access to Azure OpenAI Service. Azure OpenAI Service is currently in limited access. Users need to apply for service access at [aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access).

## Slide decks

Slide decks are available to accompany each workshop and provide a high-level introduction to the subject matter. Speaker notes are provided in each slide deck. You can find slide decks within the [slide-decks](slide-decks/) folder of this repository. The slide decks are named according to the workshop title.
