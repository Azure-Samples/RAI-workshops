# Train the Trainer Resources
Responsible AI workshops are available on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/training) as training modules. Learners will earn a badge upon completion of the module and can save their earned badges by creating a profile. If you're facilitating a workshop which leverages our Microsoft Learn training modules, we encourage you to also leverage the accompanying [slide deck](slide-decks/) provided in this repository.

## Slide decks

A general Responsible AI slide deck is available to accompany our workshops and provide a high-level introduction to Microsoft's responsible AI tooling. Speaker notes are provided within the slide deck. You can find slide deck within the [slide-decks](slide-decks/) folder of this repository.

The slides are provided in order. However, you're encouraged to present the slides that are relevant for your specific workshop. We've also included a title slide for each workshop listed in this repository.
